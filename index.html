                  <p>I have always been interested in computers since I was young and I have always wanted to teach myself how to create/program software.</p>
              </li>

                  <p>I really enjoy hiking. I really enjoy hiking for both the views and the exercise. Many hikes can physically be challenging but often there is a great view at the end which is the reward in itself! </p>

                <p>I have also really loved gaming in general and currently I play Clash Royale as well as other PC games. I enjoy playing PC games with my family and friends and it is a good way I get to spend time with them even though they aren't in the same state.

      <blockquote>
      <p>I have always wanted to learn how to program software but I was unable to get enough spare time at home to teach myself. It was difficult to try to teach myself a language after just getting off work for an hour or so each night and some times on the weekends. So I found Epicodus to be the best option because of the price, location and classroom styles. I was really encouraged by the pair programming and how it could help out, and now I am here! </p>
