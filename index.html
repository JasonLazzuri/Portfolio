  <h1>Why Coding School, Interests and Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Why Coding School?</h2>
      <p>I have always wanted to learn how to program software but I was unable to get enough spare time at home to teach myself. It was difficult to try to teach myself a language after just getting off work for an hour or so each night and some times on the weekends. So I found Epicodus to be the best option because of the price, location and classroom styles. I was really encouraged by the pair programming and how it could help out, and now I am here! </p>
      <h2>Interest and Hobbies</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Programming</h3>
              <p>I have always been interested in computers since I was young and I have always wanted to teach myself how to create/program software.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Hiking</h3>
              <p>I really enjoy hiking. I really enjoy hiking for both the views and the exercise. Many hikes can physically be challenging but often there is a great view at the end which is the reward in itself! </p>
          </li>
          <li><h3>PC/Mobile Gaming</h3>
            <p>I have also really loved gaming in general and currently I play Clash Royale as well as other PC games. I enjoy playing PC games with my family and friends and it is a good way I get to spend time with them even though they aren't in the same state.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Sports</h3>
            <p>I am a huge sports fan and I love all the local teams like the Seahawks and the Mariners and Sounders. I am also a Basketball fan of the OKC Thunder (<em>formerly the Seattle SuperSonics</em>).</p>
